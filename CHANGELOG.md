# Changelog

All notable changes are documented or linked to in this file. The format of the changelog is based on
['Keep a Changelog'](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). In short, this changelog is sorted the most recent
release at the top, and the first section documents features that are in the `development`
branch but have not yet landed in the `main` branch from which releases are generated.

The MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) of the project is documented in the [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) and in the
[README](README.md). Changes to the MSRV are considered a **non-breaking change** and thus can happen in a *MINOR*
release. They will however *never* happen in a patch release.
